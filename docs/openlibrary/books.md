And even if he could get word out, his supplies would be gone years before a rescue could arrive.\r\n\r\nChances are, though, Mark won't have time to starve to death. The damaged machinery, unforgiving environment, or plain-old \"human error\" are much more likely to kill him first. But Mark's not ready to quit. Armed with nothing but his ingenuity and his engineering skills\u2014and a gallows sense of humor that proves to be his greatest source of strength\u2014he embarks on a dogged quest to stay alive, using his botany expertise to grow food and even hatch- ing a mad plan to contact NASA back on Earth.\r\n\r\nAs he overcomes one seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next, Mark begins to let himself believe he might make it off the planet alive.\r\n\r\nBut Mars has plenty of surprises in store for him yet.\r\n\r\nGrounded in real, present-day science from the first page to the last. yet propelled by a brilliantly ingenious plot that surprises the reader again and again, The Martian is a truly remarkable thriller: an impossible-to- put-down suspense novel that manages tc read like a real-life survival tale.\r\n--front flap"
